# Description

The code has been heavily modified since the last iteration to better fit the format of an ipynb. In fact, it is now available as an interactive ![CoLab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wY4uANJyx7ZYhWDpqx2GrC-N8UJtNAeK?usp=sharing)

I am also planning to move it into the original repository but a lot of people have kept the url of the report there so my original terrible coding will remain I guess.

Either way, this represents a significant improvement (I hope) as far as usability and code quality is concerned.
