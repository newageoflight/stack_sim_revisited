# Information

The code has been heavily modified since the last iteration to better fit the format of an ipynb.

It now comes in two parts:
- [HETI's algorithm and the problem of stacking](https://colab.research.google.com/github/newageoflight/stack_sim_revisited/blob/master/heti_stack_simulator.ipynb)
- [Exploring the Queensland Ballot algorithm as an alternative to stacking](https://colab.research.google.com/github/newageoflight/stack_sim_revisited/blob/master/heti_alternatives.ipynb)

If you came here looking for the original article, please go to the link(s) above where a much nicer interactive version of this article is hosted.

Either way, this represents a significant improvement (I hope) as far as usability and code quality is concerned.
