# Information

The code has been heavily modified since the last iteration to better fit the format of an ipynb.

It now comes in two parts:
- [HETI's algorithm and the problem of stacking](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17as252hXJ9PwL7Fx8GwT1VjPmAURmQ6L?usp=sharing)
- [Exploring the Queensland Ballot algorithm as an alternative to simulated annealing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1A9ksUZJKF4neBp-ZJnZgLY-BSaZRfBmw?usp=sharing)

If you came here looking for the original article, please go to the link(s) above where a much nicer interactive version of this article is hosted. The notebook files have a lot of graphs in them so may take a while to load.

Either way, this represents a significant improvement (I hope) as far as usability and code quality is concerned.
