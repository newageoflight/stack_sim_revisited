# Information

The code has been heavily modified since the last iteration to better fit the format of an ipynb. You can either view it [right here on Github](./heti_stack_simulator.ipynb) or as an interactive [CoLab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wY4uANJyx7ZYhWDpqx2GrC-N8UJtNAeK?usp=sharing) which you can add to your Google Drive.

If you came here looking for the original article, please go to the link(s) above where a much nicer interactive version of this article is hosted.

Either way, this represents a significant improvement (I hope) as far as usability and code quality is concerned.
